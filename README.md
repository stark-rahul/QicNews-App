# **QicNewsApp**

QicNewsApp is a modern iOS application that brings you the latest US news using the [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) service. The app provides an intuitive interface to browse news articles, view detailed information about articles, and track engagement metrics such as likes and comments. Built with SwiftUI, the app leverages the latest iOS development technologies to deliver a seamless and modern user experience.

---

## **Features**

- **Latest News:** Browse a curated list of the latest US news articles with headlines, descriptions, authors, and images.  
- **Article Details:** View detailed information about individual articles, including engagement metrics (likes and comments).  
- **Async Image Loading:** Images load asynchronously with placeholders for a polished user experience.  
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages for network issues, invalid data, and API limitations.  
- **Modern Design:** Built with SwiftUI for a responsive and declarative interface.  
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive test coverage for business logic and API communication.

---

## **Prerequisites**

- **Xcode:** Version 15.0+  
- **iOS Deployment Target:** iOS 16.0+  
- **Swift:** Version 5.9+  
- **API Key:** A valid [NewsAPI.org API Key](https://newsapi.org/register) is required.

---

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd QicNewsApp
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode:**

   - Open `QicNewsApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

3. **Add Your API Key:**

   - Open `NewsAPI.swift`.  
   - Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:  
     ```swift
     private let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```

4. **Build and Run the App:**

   - Select your preferred simulator or device in Xcode.  
   - Press **⌘R** to build and run the app.

---

## **Architecture**

The app follows the **MVVM-C** (Model-View-ViewModel with Coordinator) architecture pattern to ensure a clean separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.  

- **Model:** Represents the app's data structures and handles business logic.  
- **View:** Comprises SwiftUI views for the app's user interface.  
- **ViewModel:** Acts as the middle layer to transform raw data into UI-friendly models.  
- **Coordinator:** Manages navigation and screen transitions.  
- **Services:** Encapsulate API calls and network logic.

---

## **Key Design Decisions**

- **SwiftUI:** Utilized for its declarative and reactive UI capabilities.  
- **Concurrency:** Uses `async/await` for non-blocking network calls.  
- **Protocol-Oriented Programming:** Defines reusable interfaces to improve testability.  
- **MVVM-C Pattern:** Ensures a clear separation of concerns and a modular structure.

---
## **Design Patterns**

- **dependency injection:** Used `for unit tests` for non-blocking network calls. 
- **Obstraction:** Used for dependency segrigation. 

---

## **Testing**

Run the app’s test suite to validate business logic, models, and API integration.

1. Open the project in Xcode.  
2. Press **⌘U** or navigate to **Product > Test**.  

**Test Coverage Includes:**

- **ViewModel Tests:** Validates data transformation logic.  
- **Model Tests:** Ensures data parsing accuracy.  
- **Network Service Tests:** Mocks and tests API responses.  
- **Business Logic Validation:** Confirms correct implementation of features like engagement metrics.  

---

## **Error Handling**

The app provides comprehensive error handling to ensure a smooth user experience:  

- **Invalid Data:** Validates API responses to prevent crashes.  
- **Missing Images:** Uses placeholders for missing or broken image URLs.  
- **API Rate Limiting:** Displays appropriate messages when API quotas are exceeded.

---

## **API Documentation**

The app integrates with two APIs:

### **1. NewsAPI.org**
- **Endpoint:** `https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us`  
- **Authorization:** Requires the `apiKey` as a query parameter.  
- **Response:** Provides a list of news articles in JSON format.

### **2. Article Engagement API**
- **Likes:** `https://cn-news-info-api.herokuapp.com/likes/<ARTICLEID>`  
- **Comments:** `https://cn-news-info-api.herokuapp.com/comments/<ARTICLEID>`  
- **Response:** Returns engagement metrics (likes and comments) for a specific article.

---

## **Future Improvements**

Potential enhancements to the app include:  

1. **Offline Support:** Caching articles for offline access.  
2. **Category Filtering:** Allow users to save categories for later.  
3. **Search Functionality:** Enable searching through articles.  
4. **Advanced Filtering:** Add options to filter articles by date, source, or relevance.  
5. **Image Caching:** Improve performance by caching images locally.

---

## **Attributions**

This app uses data from [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) and a custom engagement API for likes and comments.
